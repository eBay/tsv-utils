This package contains binary executables from the eBay/tsv-utils-dlang
open-source project (https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils-dlang).

The executables are in the 'bin' directory. Install by adding the 'bin'
directory or individual tools to the PATH environment variable. Run tools
with the '--help' option for help, or see the documentation in the Github
repository (https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils-dlang/blob/master/README.md).

The 'bash_completion' directory contains support for enabling command
option completion for the individual tools. For setup instructions, see
https://github.com/eBay/tsv-utils-dlang/blob/master/docs/TipsAndTricks.md#enable-bash-completion.
